# MusicXML reader program

This is a program that has been constructed to read musicxml files.

Currently this program is only able to read the older format of musicXML (files ending in .musicxml or .xml) due to the newer .mxml file being compressed in order to save space

If you want to test this with your own MusicXML files you can export MusicXML from musescore by selecting File>Export>format: "MusicXML">file type: "uncompressed (*.musicxml)"

## For my teachers
I have included some example MusicXML files that I have been using to test the program in the test_files directory, these were not created or scored by me, and are the intelecual property of their individual creators.
