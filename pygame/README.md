# Spacewar! 2
My programming assignment

## About the game
This game was inspired by the [Spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!) (Hence the name for this game), one of the first computer games ever developed, originally made on the PDP-1 at MIT. I was originally going to also include the gravity well thing but ended up running out of time.

The controls might seem weird too, they were inspired by the controls for Celeste

## Other stuff
Instructions and stuff are all inside the game. This was a good exercise in better programming project structure and using docstrings properly (I <3 the vsc docstrings extension). Also was fun to learn pygame.
